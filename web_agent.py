The basic layout of the web agent is going to be as the following - 
1) We are going to build a chromium/selenium web driver plugin - done
2) Next we are going to take screenshots using omniparser 
3) These annotated screenshots are then going to be sent to azure ai inference for processing 
4) We are going to start with a prompt, get the website, navigate to the website, take a screenshot, use omni parser to annotate the screenshot and process using azure ai
